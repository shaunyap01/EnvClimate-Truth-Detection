## Evaluating Environment & Climate Truthfulness in Social Media using Deep Learning & Large Language Models (LLMs)

### Overview

This repository contains the code, models, and scripts used in the dissertation "Evaluating Environment & Climate Truthfulness in Social Media using Deep Learning & Large Language Models (LLMs)" by Shaun Yap for the MSc in Data Science at the University of Exeter. The project focuses on detecting climate and environmental misinformation on social media using a combination of traditional machine learning models, deep learning architectures, and OpenAI's GPT-4o.
